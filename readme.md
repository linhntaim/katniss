## Installation

### Environment file

Duplicate the file named `.env.example` at the root directory of the application and change the name of the duplicated file to `.env`.

Change some configuration as you want.

Enable write permission for some directories:

```
chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
chmod -R 777 storage
chmod -R 777 public/assets/cache
chmod -R 777 public/files
```

### PHP

Require PHP >= `5.6.4`.

Current version: `7.0.9`.

### Database

MySQL is recommended.

Require MySQL >= `5.5`.

Current version: `MariaDB 10.1.16`.

Current database settings (in the `.env` file) of the framework require you to make those configuration in MySQL (`my.ini` or `my.cnf` file):

```php
innodb_file_format=BARRACUDA
innodb_large_prefix=ON
```

Those settings require to create database `katniss` with `default character set utf8mb4` and `default collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci`

After creating, you should initialize database by running these commands when in root directory of the application:

`composer install`

`php artisan migrate --seed`

**Notice:**

If you change the current database settings (in the `.env` file) to:

```php
DB_CHARSET=utf8
DB_COLLATION=utf8_unicode_ci
```

Then, you don't have to change MySQL configuration.

Therefore, you must create database `katniss` with `default character set utf8` and `default collate utf8_unicode_ci`

Furthermore, you must go through all the migrating files in directory `root\database\migrations` and delete these lines when you see them in the code:

```php
$table->engine = 'InnoDB';
$table->rowFormat = 'DYNAMIC';
```
